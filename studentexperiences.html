                  <p>At Oklahoma Christian, I have consistently been challenged in my academics. There is 
                    always something new to learn. The vast amount of content available can be overwhelming,
                    but the teachers are always readily available to help you. On top of that, there are so many
                    online resources that can help with classes, it is very realistic to consistently succeed
                    in the Computer Science program. Upperclassmen are extremely kind and helpful, and are 
                    always willing to give advice on how to work smarter and be successful.

                  <p>Initially when I came here, I wanted to be an Electrical Engineer because my step-dad is an electritian, so I 
                    thought I would enjoy it. To get a major in Electrical Engineering, students have to take several programming courses. 
                    I did my first semester and I was taking a programming course and several Electrical Engineering classes. I had come to the 
                    conclusion that I did not want to continue in Electrical Engineering. I looked at what classes I was taking and found out the class 
                    I enjoyed the most was Programming I, so I talked to my professor and he advised me and helped me make the decision to switch. I 
                    decided to switch to Computer Science, and I truly believe that it was the best decision I could have made. I love my professors ( seriously, 
                    every one of them ), and I love the classes. The course material is very appropriately challenging and it is perfect for teaching 
                    all of the things that one needs to know to be a part of the Computer Science industry. Getting a degree in Computer Science at Oklahoma 
                    Christian University is the greatest decision I ever made and could be yours too!
